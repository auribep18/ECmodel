    "## Analyis of EMEP Source-receptor tables v. 23.08.2024\n",

    "## Introduction: \n",
    "The EMEP program is a scientifically based and policy-driven initiative under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for international cooperation in solving transboundary air pollution problems. This program shares with the scientific community Source-Receptor (SR) tables, which are calculated using the EMEP MSC-W model. The model is based on meteorological data from ECMWF-IFS and covers the EMEP domain (30°N–82°N latitude, 30°W–90°E longitude) with a 0.3°×0.2° longitude-latitude resolution. These tables illustrate the changes in air concentrations or depositions due to variations in emissions from each country, calculated using the 15% perturbation method. They address two fundamental questions about transboundary air pollution: Where do the pollutants emitted by a country or region end up? Where do the pollutants in a given country or region come from?.  The changes in PM2.5 concentrations are computed on a perturbation of 15% of emission reductions, for pollutants such as SOx, NOx, NH3, NMVOC, and PPM that are primary source of PM2.5.\n",
    "Source: Elaborated on https://www.emep.int/\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reads the data presented in the SR Tables for PM2.5 from the years 2012 to 2021. The data has been previously processed in an Excel file called \"PanelSR.xlsx\"."

    "##### Interpretation of Time Trend of Emissions: \n",
    "The coefficient for Year is -3.5561, which is slightly more negative than in the simple OLS model without fixed effects. This indicates that, after controlling for country-specific factors, emissions are still decreasing over time, but the trend is more pronounced. Adding country-specific fixed effects accounts for unobserved heterogeneity between countries, improving the model’s explanatory power. There is an average decrease in emissions of approximately 3.6 gigagrams (Gg) per year. Model 2 now explains about 63.7% of the variance in emissions (R-squared), which is a substantial improvement over the simple OLS model that only included Year. With fixed effects included, the time trend (Year coefficient) reflects within-country changes in emissions over time, independent of the country-specific baseline differences. This makes the time trend more accurate and meaningful."
